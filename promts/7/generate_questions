your task is to read the following Questions (marked with ## Questions) and generate a CSV as in The ## Template of the form

## Template
topic;question;a;b;c;d;correctAnswer;explanation;difficulty;language
- "topic": topic should be detected
- "question": question should be copied
- "a,b,c,d": if Multiple Options are provided they should be copied to to columns: a,b,c,d otherwise leave blank
- "correctAnswer": if Multiple options were provided insert correct option by cell name e.g. [a,b,c,d]. if correct opion is given in Question just copy it if not think extra hard to deduce it. if no options are given leave blank
- "explanation": if explanation is provided copy it otherwise think carefully and explain the question yourself
- "difficulty": rate the difficulty your self
- "language": the language of the question
