Your task is to read all entries below marked with "## Questions" and convert them into a CSV following the schema:

## Template
topic;question;a;b;c;d;correctAnswer;explanation;difficulty;language

Rules:
- topic: Detect the question’s topic from context (headings or keywords). If unclear, infer the most relevant domain concept.
- question: Copy the question verbatim.
- a,b,c,d: Copy up to four answer options if provided. If fewer, leave remaining cells blank. If more than four, include first four only.
- correctAnswer: 
  - If options exist and a correct one is indicated, insert its column letter (a,b,c,d).
  - If the correct answer is stated in text, copy it.
  - If unknown, leave blank.
- explanation:
  - If an explanation is provided, copy it.
  - If not, write a concise, factual reasoning (1–2 sentences).
- difficulty: Rate difficulty as one of [easy, medium, hard].
- language: Detect automatically using ISO 639-1 codes (EN, DE, etc.).

If irrelevant text appears between questions, ignore it.
