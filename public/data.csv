Game Theory;Which method is commonly used to analyze repeated games with finite repetitions?;Backward induction;Bayesian inference;Monte Carlo simulation;Markov processes;a;Backward induction is used to determine the optimal strategy in finite repeated games.;;EN
Game Theory;Which factor primarily distinguishes finite and infinite repeated games?;The number of players;The predictability of end conditions;The presence of mixed strategies;The absence of equilibrium;b;Finite games have a known endpoint, affecting strategic behavior differently from infinite games.;;EN
Game Theory;What is a key characteristic of repeated games?;They always lead to cooperative behavior.;They only occur in infinite settings.;Players can condition their strategy based on past actions.;The payoffs remain constant regardless of decisions.;c;Repeated games allow strategies to evolve based on historical play, enabling cooperation or defection.;;EN
Game Theory;Why does the end-game effect influence player behavior in finite repeated games?;It eliminates future consequences for current actions.;It increases the importance of initial moves.;It encourages players to adopt dominant strategies.;It ensures cooperation through mutual interest.;a;Players in the final stages of a finite game have no reason to maintain cooperative behavior, as retaliation is no longer a threat.;;EN
Game Theory;Explain how backward induction is used to determine equilibrium in finite repeated games.;;;;;;A good answer should explain how backward induction works by solving the game from the last stage backward to determine the optimal strategy at each step.;;EN
Game Theory;Compare and contrast the strategic implications of finite and infinite repeated games.;;;;;;A good answer should highlight how the known endpoint in finite games affects strategies differently than infinite games, where cooperation is more sustainable.;;EN
Game Theory;Discuss the significance of the end-game effect in repeated games and how it influences strategic decisions.;;;;;;The response should explain how the absence of future retaliation in the last stage alters player strategies, often leading to defection.;;EN

Market Entry;Which factor decreases the likelihood of market entry according to the study?;Low demand variation;High strategic flexibility;High demand variation;Presence of competitors;c;The study finds that higher demand variation discourages firms from entering a market due to increased uncertainty.;;EN
Strategic Flexibility;What is the key trade-off involved in strategic flexibility?;Cost vs. Efficiency;Efficiency vs. Flexibility;Market Entry vs. Competition;Risk vs. Profitability;b;Firms must balance strategic flexibility with efficiency, as flexibility can reduce operational efficiency but enable better adaptation.;;EN
Demand Variation;How is demand variation measured in the study?;By absolute passenger volume;By coefficient of variation in demand;By seasonality trends;By competitor presence;b;The study operationalizes demand variation using the coefficient of variation in total industry demand for a given market.;;EN
Predictability;When is strategic flexibility most valuable?;When demand is stable;When demand is highly predictable;When demand is highly unpredictable;When competition is low;c;The study suggests that strategic flexibility is most valuable when demand is unpredictable and fluctuating.;;EN
Airline Industry;Which measure is used to assess an airline’s flexibility?;Number of employees;Fleet size;Number of different aircraft types operated;Total revenue;c;The study measures strategic flexibility by counting the number of different aircraft types an airline operates.;;EN
Market Conditions;Which type of firm is more likely to enter markets with high demand variation?;Highly efficient firms;Highly flexible firms;Low-cost carriers;New market entrants;b;Firms with greater strategic flexibility are more likely to enter markets with high demand variation, as they can better adapt to changes.;;EN
Economic Implications;Why do firms with low flexibility avoid markets with high demand variation?;They lack sufficient capital;They cannot adjust capacity efficiently;They prefer international expansion;They do not analyze market trends;b;Low-flexibility firms struggle to adjust capacity efficiently in response to fluctuations, making them less competitive in volatile markets.;;EN
Market Entry;Explain the relationship between demand variation and market entry. Discuss why high demand variation discourages firms from entering new markets.;;;;;;The answer should describe how high demand variation increases uncertainty and operational challenges, discouraging market entry.;;EN
Strategic Management;How does strategic flexibility impact a firm's ability to enter a new market? Provide examples from the airline industry.;;;;;;The response should highlight how flexibility allows firms to better adapt to demand variation and support their market entry decisions.;;EN
Industry Insights;Discuss the role of predictability in strategic flexibility. How does it influence market entry decisions?;;;;;;The answer should explain how predictable and unpredictable demand variations affect firms' entry strategies and the need for flexibility.;;EN


Market Entry;Which of the following is NOT a structural entry barrier?;Economies of scale;Brand loyalty;Control of essential resources;Aggressive pricing;d;Aggressive pricing is a strategic entry barrier, not a structural one. Structural barriers arise from the industry’s nature.;;EN
Porter’s Five Forces;Which force directly affects price elasticity in an industry?;Supplier bargaining power;Buyer bargaining power;Threat of substitutes;Government regulation;c;The threat of substitutes impacts price elasticity as consumers have alternative options, limiting firms' ability to raise prices.;;EN
Entry Strategies;What is a key feature of the 'Judo Economics' entry strategy?;Maximizing capacity to challenge incumbents;Pricing aggressively to dominate the market;Keeping a small market share to avoid retaliation;Focusing on premium customers only;c;Judo Economics involves setting a low price and keeping capacity limited to avoid triggering aggressive retaliation from incumbents.;;EN
Commitment Strategy;How can an entrant use commitment to deter retaliation from incumbents?;By entering multiple markets simultaneously;By making high sunk-cost investments;By acquiring competitors;By avoiding direct competition;b;High sunk-cost investments signal a strong commitment to stay in the market, making retaliation less attractive for incumbents.;;EN
Limit Pricing;What is the purpose of limit pricing?;To maximize short-term profits;To signal low demand or high competition;To increase economies of scale;To ensure price stability;b;Limit pricing involves setting a low price to discourage market entry by signaling unattractive market conditions.;;EN
Predatory Pricing;Which condition makes predatory pricing viable?;Complete market transparency;Presence of incomplete information;High fixed costs;Low customer switching costs;b;Predatory pricing works when there is incomplete information, making it difficult for competitors to assess true costs and intentions.;;EN
Niche Market Strategy;Why might incumbents avoid retaliating against niche entrants?;Niche entrants operate at lower costs;Incumbents have high market power;Across-the-board retaliation may be infeasible;Niche entrants have superior technology;c;Incumbents may avoid retaliation when a niche entrant focuses on a small segment where price adjustments are impractical.;;EN
Market Entry;Explain the difference between structural and strategic entry barriers, providing real-world examples.;;;;;;The answer should describe structural barriers as inherent to the industry (e.g., economies of scale) and strategic barriers as actions taken by incumbents (e.g., predatory pricing).;;EN
Competitive Strategy;How does the concept of 'Judo Economics' influence entry decisions? Provide an example.;;;;;;The response should discuss the principles of Judo Economics, including limited capacity and pricing strategies, with an example like Amazon’s entry strategy.;;EN
Pricing Strategies;Compare and contrast limit pricing and predatory pricing. How do these strategies deter new entrants?;;;;;;The answer should highlight how limit pricing discourages entry by signaling low profitability, while predatory pricing involves temporary losses to force competitors out.;;EN
