Google Cloud Data Processing;Cymbal Direct drones continuously send data during deliveries. You need to process and analyze the incoming telemetry data. After processing, the data should be retained, but it will only be accessed once every month or two. Your CIO has issued a directive to incorporate managed services wherever possible. You want a cost-effective solution to process the incoming streams of data. What should you do?;Ingest data with ClearBlade IoT Core, process it with Dataprep, and store it in a Coldline Cloud Storage bucket.;Ingest data with ClearBlade IoT Core, and then publish to Pub/Sub. Use BigQuery to process the data, and store it in a Standard Cloud Storage bucket.;Ingest data with ClearBlade IoT Core, and then publish to Pub/Sub. Use Dataflow to process the data, and store it in a Nearline Cloud Storage bucket.;Ingest data with ClearBlade IoT Core, and then store it in BigQuery.;c;Dataflow is the managed service for stream processing in Google Cloud. Telemetry should be ingested via IoT Core, streamed through Pub/Sub, processed in Dataflow, and archived in Nearline storage since access is infrequent but retention is needed.;medium;EN
Google Cloud Networking;You are creating a new project. You plan to set up a Dedicated interconnect between two of your data centers in the near future and want to ensure that your resources are only deployed to the same regions where your data centers are located. You need to make sure that you don’t have any overlapping IP addresses that could cause conflicts when you set up the interconnect. You want to use RFC 1918 class B address space. What should you do?;Create a new project, delete the default VPC network, set up an auto mode VPC network, and then use the default 10.x.x.x network range to create subnets in your desired regions.;Create a new project, delete the default VPC network, set up a custom mode VPC network, and then use IP addresses in the 172.16.x.x address range to create subnets in your desired regions.;Create a new project, leave the default network in place, and then use the default 10.x.x.x network range to create subnets in your desired regions.;Create a new project, delete the default VPC network, set up the network in custom mode, and then use IP addresses in the 192.168.x.x address range to create subnets in your desired zones. Use VPC Network Peering to connect the zones in the same region to create regional networks.;b;A custom mode VPC allows explicit subnet definition per region, preventing IP overlap. The 172.16.0.0/12 block is an RFC 1918 class B address range, ideal for interconnect planning.;medium;EN
Google Cloud Interconnect & Peering;Cymbal Direct is working with Cymbal Retail, a separate, autonomous division of Cymbal with different staff, networking teams, and data center. Cymbal Direct and Cymbal Retail are not in the same Google Cloud organization. Cymbal Retail needs access to Cymbal Direct’s web application for making bulk orders, but the application will not be available on the public internet. You want to ensure that Cymbal Retail has access to your application with low latency. You also want to avoid egress network charges if possible. What should you do?;If Cymbal Retail does not have access to a Google Cloud data center, use Carrier Peering to connect the two networks.;Verify that the subnet range Cymbal Retail is using doesn’t overlap with Cymbal Direct’s subnet range, and then enable VPC Network Peering for the project.;Verify that the subnet Cymbal Retail is using has the same IP address range with Cymbal Direct’s subnet range, and then enable VPC Network Peering for the project.;Specify Cymbal Direct’s project as the Shared VPC host project, and then configure Cymbal Retail’s project as a service project.;b;VPC Network Peering allows private communication between projects across different organizations without egress costs. Non-overlapping IP ranges are required for peering to work.;medium;EN
